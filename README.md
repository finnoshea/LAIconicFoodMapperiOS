A google maps interface app for the LA Magazine 100 Iconic dishes article.

I am writing this app to learn Swift.

The goal of this app is to have a main view with a Google map showing the location of all the brick-and-mortar restaurants on the LA Magazine 100 Most Iconic Dishes of Los Angeles and the user's location.  Green pins for restaurants whose dishes the user has had and red pins for restaurants with dishes the user hasn't had.  When the user taps the pins on the map, it will show him/her the dish that is on the Iconic list.  
A secondary view is the table view of the dishes and where they can be found.  This list is 100 items long and includes the food truck and cart items that cannot be displayed on the map because if Google can't find them, I cannot either.  In this view the user can tap on the desired location name and he/she will be taken back to the map and shown the nearest location for that restaurant.  The user can also check off items and see a running total of X/100 at the top.
